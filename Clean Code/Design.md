# Object Oriented Design

## Lack of Design

Failure of OOD might look like failures of coding technique but they are actually failures of perspective.

## Cost of Change

Something always change. It always does. The customers didn't know what they wanted, they didn't say what they meant. You didn't understand their needs, you've learned how to do something better, etc.

It is the need for change that makes design matter.

Dependencies stand in the way of change.

You must combine an overall understanding of your application's requirements with knowledge of costs and benefits of design alternatives and then devise an arrangement of code that is cost effective in the present and will continue to be so in the future.

Design that anticipate specific future requirements almost always end badly. Practical design does not anticipate what will happen to your application, it merely accepts that something will and that, in the present, you cannot know what.

## Principles and Patterns

OO designer has tools - principles and patterns.

## Overdesign

A little bit of knowledge is dangerous; as their knowledge increases, they design relentlessly. In an excess of enthusiasm they apply principles inappropriately and see patterns where none exist.

## Iterative

The iterative nature of Agile development allows design to adjust regularly and to evolve naturally.

You customers can't define the software they want before seeing it, so it's best to show them sooner rather than later. Thus software should be build in tiny increments, gradually iterating your way into an application that meets the customer's true need.

> If lack of a feature will force you out of business today it doesn't matter how much it will cost to deal with the code tomorrow.
